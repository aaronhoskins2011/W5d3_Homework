Airship config options are a convenient way to pass custom settings to your app without needing to edit the source code. By default the Urban Airship SDK loads these settings from the airshipconfig.properties file located in your applicationâ€™s assets directory. Use this file, among other things, to set the backend credentials for your app, and to toggle between development and production builds.
